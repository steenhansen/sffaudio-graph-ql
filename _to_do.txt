position FEWD2019-2i

Hello Brinkman Laboratory,
I found your job description on Indeed.ca interesting, and I believe I am a 
good fit.

I really enjoy using React along with Node.js; especially server-side 
rendering of components. I used to do a lot of jQuery when I worked with PHP.

While at ISMP Canada I worked on https://www.ismp-canada.org/abx the Ontario 
Antimicrobial Stewardship Project, where I wrote the data collection program
in JavaScript/Ajax/PHP. Because participating hospitals were anonymous and we
didn't know which browser they would utilize, I used Selenium to automate
browser testing of the program to ensure no errors.

My GitHub repository is https://github.com/steenhansen and here are some of my
online programs that use JavaScript technologies:

 - https://sffaudio-search.herokuapp.com/?book=dune&author=frank-herbert
   is a single page app I built with Node.js/Ajax/SVG and is used for searching
   on https://www.sffaudio.com/search/?book=dune&author=frank-herbert.

 - Dragging markers on and off of Google Maps, https://gddr.herokuapp.com/maps
   I made with JavaScript/React.
        
 - Dynamic image re-sizing, https://react-hover-grid.herokuapp.com
   I produced with Node.js/React to fit changing browser widths.

 - A copy of the old Breakout game, https://steenhansen.github.io/gh-pages
   I created with JavaScript/ES6.
